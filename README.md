# How to get set up with my random api's

Make sure you have NodeJs and NPM installed (Installation varries from OS to OS) along with git

Next run this command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/galaxine-senpai/random-apis.git
```

Once done cd into it by just going ```cd random-apis```

Extra step for linux:

Make sure you run chown on it:
```bash
sudo chown -R $USER random-apis
```

Now we are onto the .env portion...

Go into the .env and change the port number to anything desired (or you can leave it as is)

> Do not forget to change it from example.env to .env

Once all of that is done now we do the dependancy installation!

Just simply run ```npm i``` now you just have to wait a bit

Once done you can now run it by using the follwoing command!

Windows:
```bash
node index.js
```

Linux:
```bash
sudo node index.js
```

(Again for linux) If you wish to run it as a server you can use nohup:
```bash
sudo nohup node index.js &
```

And now you have some random api's running!
